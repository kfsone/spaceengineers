Experimenting with Malware-DEV's SDK.

ArmChurn is meant to operate a rotating, expanding, drill-head.

If you're going to drill down into the surface, you'd have a rotor, piston, junction, piston and
drill.

How these are configured is up to you, but in my case, assuming drilling down into the ground,
the rotor is at the top facing the ground; the first piston controls the depth of drilling; the
second piston and drill are horizontal.

ArmChurn first turns the rotor to drill out a complete circle. Then it extends the first piston
to lower the 'drill head'. When the piston has reached full extension, it retracts it back to the
top and then extends the second piston slightly before again extending the first piston out to
maximum extent.

At each step, I support multiple blocks, so for example you can have multiple drills or drills
facing n/s/e/w so that you only need a 90-degree rotation to complete an entire layer.

WORK IN PROGRESS.
